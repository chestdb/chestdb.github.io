## Can Chest run on all platforms?

Chest runs on all platforms where the DartVM runs.
That's pretty much anywhere Dart runs except the browser.

Browser support is planned for the future though.

## Where are my chests stored?

Chests are stored in files inside the directory specified by `Chest.rootPath`.
Usually, that's the directory from where your program is run.

## Is Chest type-safe?

Yes, it is.
You need to register types before though.

## Can objects contain cycles?

Nope. Chest will detect them and throw an error. (TODO: It doesn't yet.)

## Can I open the same chest twice?

Nope. Chest will detect that and throw an error.

## Can I create the same chest twice and open both of them?

Yes! Both chest instances will actually connect to the same backend.
But you could just as easily make the chest global.
Because the objects you get from a chest are not referenced by others, that's okay ‚Äì Chest is similar to riverpod in that regard.

## Can I create and open the same chest on multiple isolates?

Sadly, no.
Chest's architecture would actually support that ‚Äì the file access and all other expensive operations happen on another isolate.
But an isolate can't find another isolate without having some communication beforehand, so there's no way for both isolates to find and communicate with a shared backend.

If this is important to you, consider giving [this issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/44495) an upvote. üëç

## Can I open the same chest on multiple processes?

This won't work.
Please don't try this.

## Do I have to close the chests?

No, you don't. If you don't, your program won't stop automatically though.
So if you have a console application, the program will run infinitely long if you don't close the chest.
If you're using Flutter, don't worry about closing chests.
